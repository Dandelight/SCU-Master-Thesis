  abstract       = {We derive a semi-discrete two-dimensional elliptic global Carleman estimate, in which the usual large parameter is connected to the one-dimensional discretization step-size. The discretizations we address are some families of smoothly varying meshes. As a consequence of the Carleman estimate, we derive a partial spectral inequality of the form of that proven by G. Lebeau and L. Robbiano, in the case of a discrete elliptic operator in one dimension. Here, this inequality concerns the lower part of the discrete spectrum. The range of eigenvalues/eigenfunctions we treat is however quasi-optimal and represents a constant portion of the discrete spectrum. For the associated parabolic problem, we then obtain a uniform null controllability result for this lower part of the spectrum. Moreover, with the control function that we construct, the L2-norm of the final state converges to zero super-algebraically as the step-size of the discretization goes to zero. A relaxed observability estimate is then deduced. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},
  comment        = {Main purpose is to prove uniform controlliablity and observesitily inequality. They use the lebeau Robbiano inequality of discrete form. To get this, they obtain the discrete Carleman estimate which is the most important part in this paper.},
